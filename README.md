# Multi-label-Image-Classification
Coursework project (group of 3) using Pytorch. It involved multi-class classification on an imbalanced data of images where each instance was labelled with one or more classes. Modelling was done using deep learning models such as ResNet-50 and DenseNet-161 along with BERT to obtain an accuracy of 79%
